# Background music

The site uses two tracks:

| Key    | Track | File (in code) |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **2026**  | Festive | `其它/djartmusic-prosperity-festival-289465.mp3` or `audio/general.mp3` |
| **Miluna** | Romantic | Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra - Somethin' Stupid (Audio).mp3 in `其它/` or `audio/miluna.mp3` |

**Option 1:** Put the two MP3s in the **`其它`** folder with the exact names above (see repo root **AUDIO-AND-GITHUB.md**).

**Option 2:** Put them here in **`audio/`** as **general.mp3** (festive) and **miluna.mp3** (Somethin' Stupid). The HTML will use these if the 其它 paths are missing.

Music starts after the user enters a key. Use the 🎵/🔇 button (bottom-right) to mute or unmute. See **AUDIO-AND-GITHUB.md** for detailed GitHub steps.
